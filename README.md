# Frontend code review exercise

An HTML/CSS/JS template to review and discuss with the Studio 24 frontend team.

To accommodate individual circumstances, you can choose to do this exercise as a take home test, or live on the day of your interview.
The instructions will be slightly different depending on which way you choose to do it.

## The exercise
We picked this exercise from the Frontendmentor.io website: https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/project-tracking-intro-component-5d289097500fcb331a67d80e

We quickly built the layout using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

We are asking you to review the code and give your feedback on it. In other words:

* Which improvements would you make to the code?
* And why?

Please feel free to comment on the design or other aspects of the project if you think it is relevant.

## If you do this as a live test
You have decided to do this exercise on the day of your interview.

* You will be given 20 minutes to look at the code by yourself. 
* We will remain available for any question during that time. 
* You can use your favourite code editor and browser to view the code.
* You can take notes whichever way you like.
* You can use the internet or any other resource you like to use.
* After that you will be invited to give your feedback on the code and discuss it with a member of the frontend development team.

## If you do this as a take home test
You have decided to do this exercise at home.

We will ask you to make changes in the code and send us back your improved copy of the project. When you do so, please let us know roughly how long the exercise took you.

The following rules apply:

* We trust that you will do this exercise yourself, without help from another developer, and that you will be honest about the time it took you to do it.
* You can however use the internet or any other resource you like  - just not another human.
* Please comment the changes you make in the code. Comments should explain why you think that change is an improvement.
* Feel free to provide a document with further comments/suggestions if you don't think commenting the code is the right format for these. 
* Please stick to HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS in your code. I.e. no SCSS, no JS framework, no front-end framework (such as Bootstrap), no build tools (such as NPM scripts, Gulp, WebPack. etc)
* However, feel free to make recommendations as to the use of these tools if you think it is relevant. 

## Getting started

Simply open the index.html file into your favourite browser. We kept things simple: there are no build tools or deployment process involved.
